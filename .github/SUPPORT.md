Looking for support for one of my projects?  Here are some suggestions:

### ðŸ™‹ [Asking Quality Questions](#toc)

> #### ðŸ‘‰ If this is your first time participating in one of my communities, please read and adhere to the [code of conduct][coc].  By interacting with any of my repositories or communities, you agree to abide by these terms.

If you have any questions, join the [`Discord Server`][discord]

> **Give yourself the best chance of getting the help you need!  Spend a little time framing your question and adding links and resources.  Spending a little extra time up-front can save everyone time (and frustration) in the long-run.  Here are a few tips:**

- [**Talk to a rubber duck**](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)
- Don't bring us an [**X/Y Problem**](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378)
- SEARCH to see if your question has already been asked
- WOE BETIDE the fool who opens an issue ANYWHERE to ask about **their own code**!
- Try to succinctly define what you need help with:
	- Is there something in particular you are trying to do?
	- What _exactly_ is the problem you've encountered?
	- What _exactly_ have you done so far to try to fix it?
	- Is there something you don't understand?
- Provide `sample code`, such as [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or a video
	- anyone posting an entire page of code will very quickly find their discussion topic locked
	- serial offenders will be banned from ALL of my projects
- Screenshots are great, but if they contain error messages, please also provide those as text
- The more time you put into asking your question, the more likely you are to get an answer
	- anyone who makes a habit of posting lazy questions will share the fate of those who post pages of code (and those who )!
